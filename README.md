✈ Secure Aircraft Communications: Penetration Testing & Hardening
📌 Overview

This project simulates cyber threats against aircraft communication and control systems in a controlled lab environment. It demonstrates:

Penetration testing of cockpit–ground communication and CI/CD pipelines.

Secure software craftsmanship through end-to-end encryption, signed updates, and resilient CI/CD.

Curiosity-driven research into aviation cyber risks such as GPS spoofing and misinformation.

⚠ Ethical note: All simulations are fully contained in lab environments. No real aircraft systems or production infrastructure were targeted.

🎯 Objectives

Simulate real-world attacker techniques against an aircraft-like communication platform.

Identify vulnerabilities in cockpit-to-ground messages, maintenance portals, and CI/CD updates.

Apply secure engineering practices (MFA, digital signing, reproducible builds, failover).

Build SIEM detections and aviation-specific incident response playbooks.

Research emerging risks such as GPS spoofing and misinformation in flight operations.

🔍 Scenario Context

Aircraft rely on SaaS-style platforms for communication, scheduling, and maintenance updates. These systems are attractive targets for attackers:

Phishing to steal crew/maintenance credentials.

Replay/injection attacks on cockpit–ground communication.

Supply-chain compromise in flight software CI/CD.

DoS/DDoS attempts on ground comms servers.

In this project, these risks were recreated in a simulated aircraft communications lab to test detection, prevention, and response.

⚙ Methodology

Phase 1 — Threat Modeling

Defined attacker personas: state-sponsored APT vs hacktivist.

Identified assets: crew authentication, communication data, software updates.

Phase 2 — Penetration Testing (Controlled Lab)

API & web fuzzing for maintenance portal.

Replay attacks against cockpit–ground data streams.

Introduced malicious dependency in a vulnerable CI/CD pipeline.

Stress-tested comms server with simulated DoS in Dockerized lab.

Phase 3 — Secure Software Craftsmanship

Enforced end-to-end encryption + digital signing for cockpit messages.

Hardened CI/CD pipelines with artifact signing, dependency pinning, reproducible builds.

Applied RBAC + MFA for crew and ground staff authentication.

Implemented graceful failover for comms outages.

Phase 4 — Detection & Response

Built SIEM rules for abnormal comms traffic, repeated failed crew logins, and CI/CD anomalies.

Designed aviation cyber incident playbooks for compromised maintenance portals and comms tampering.

Phase 5 — Curiosity & Research

Explored GPS spoofing in a safe, simulated environment.

Researched misinformation injection into comms channels.

Mapped threats to MITRE ATT&CK for ICS/aviation.
